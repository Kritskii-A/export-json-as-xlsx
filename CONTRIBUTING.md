## Requirements

These are the software versions I personally use

```shell
$ node --version
v16.14.2
$ npm --version
8.5.0
$ yarn --version
1.22.19
```

Other versions may work but I can not guarantee that

## Develop locally

It will start the library and demo project in dev mode

```shell
$ yarn start
```

- Express: localhost:5500
- ReactJS: localhost:6500

## Code linting

This project uses `prettier` for linting code

## Deploy to NPM

There is a pipeline for that, just do a PR and it will be merged
