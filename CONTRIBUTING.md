## Requirements

This are the software versions that I personally use

```shell
$ node --version
v16.14.2
$ npm --version
8.5.0
$ yarn --version
1.22.19
```

Others may work, but I can not guarantee that

## Develop locally

It will start the library in dev mode along with a ReactJS and Express projects

```shell
$ yarn start
```

## Linting code

This project uses `prettier` for linting code

## Deploy to NPM

There is a pipeline for that, just do a PR and I'll be merged
